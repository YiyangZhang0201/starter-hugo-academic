n the example, we use Subgradient algorithm we built in our package to 
do the optimization for the mathematical model we built. We want to use this model to construct an 
Index fund by using only part of its corresponding market Indexâ€™s components. And based on the result 
of the optimization, we test the optimal model on the out-of-sample period and found that it is highly 
effective. Our constructed Index follows the trend of corresponding Market Index pretty well.
