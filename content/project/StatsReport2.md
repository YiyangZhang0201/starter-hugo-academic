Diabetic Retinopathy is a diabetes complication that affects the eyes. It is caused by damage to the blood vessels at the retina or back of the eye. Diabetic retinopathy may have no symptoms or only mild vision problems at first. However, it can lead to blindness in the end. This can happen to anyone who has type 1 or 2 diabetes. Moreover, the longer the length of the diabetes history and the less controlled the blood sugar is, the chance of diabetic retinopathy is higher.

Our statistical analysis report will focus on two laser treatments: argon and xenon. We need to identify and quantify the efficacy of treatment type on visual acuity and the improvement between eyes by treatment type. Also, we need to understand the potential impact that age at diagnosis and clinical risk of diabetic retinopathy have on visual acuity. In this way, our analysis result can help our client get a better result on treatment to delay diabetic retinopathy.

* Both treatment types are similar in their eï¬ƒcacy on visual acuity.
* Higher clinical risk is associated with a higher risk of vision loss.
